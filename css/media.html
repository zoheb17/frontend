What is a Media Query?
Imagine you have magic clothes 👕👗.
These clothes change automatically depending on:


If it’s hot or cold


If you’re big or small


If you’re inside or outside



📱💻 Now think about a website
A website is like a storybook on a screen.
People can open it on:


A phone 📱 (small screen)


A tablet 📲 (medium screen)


A computer 💻 (big screen)



🪄 Media Query = Magic Rule
A media query is a magic rule that tells the website:

“If the screen is small, show things this way.”
“If the screen is big, show things that way.”

So the website looks nice and easy to read on every device ❤️

🧠 Super Simple Example


On a phone 📱 → Big buttons, big text


On a computer 💻 → More pictures, smaller text


The media query decides this 🤖✨

🧸 Short & Sweet Definition
Media Query is a magic helper that helps websites change their look so they fit phones, tablets, and computers nicely.
